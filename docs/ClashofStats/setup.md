## General Information

You have two option when setting up this bot for your server

1. Use the discord bot we host (Recommended for those with no discordpy experience)
    - Benefits:
        - You don't have to go through the trouble of hosting your own discord bot
        - If you already use our bot on a server, your account information will transfer over automatically
            - Linked Bases and clans


2. Host the discord bot yourself (Recommended for those with basic discordpy experience)
    - Benefits:
        - You can use a custom bot name and picture
        - You can add custom commands
            - See [Custom Commands](customcommands)
